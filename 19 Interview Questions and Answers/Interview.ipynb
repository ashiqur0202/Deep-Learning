    "44) What is an RNN?\n",
    "RNN stands for Recurrent Neural Networks. These are the artificial neural networks which are designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data such as handwriting, text, the spoken word, genomes, and numerical time series data. RNN use backpropagation algorithm for training because of their internal memory. RNN can remember important things about the input they received, which enables them to be very precise in predicting what's coming next."

    "45) What are the issues faced while training in Recurrent Networks?\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Network uses backpropagation algorithm for training, but it is applied on every timestamp. It is usually known as Back-propagation Through Time (BTT).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two significant issues with Back-propagation, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanishing Gradient\n",
    "When we perform Back-propagation, the gradients tend to get smaller and smaller because we keep on moving backward in the Network. As a result, the neurons in the earlier layer learn very slowly if we compare it with the neurons in the later layers.Earlier layers are more valuable because they are responsible for learning and detecting simple patterns. They are the building blocks of the network.\n",
    "If they provide improper or inaccurate results, then how can we expect the next layers and complete network to perform nicely and provide accurate results. The training procedure tales long, and the prediction accuracy of the model decreases.\n",
    "Exploding Gradient\n",
    "Exploding gradients are the main problem when large error gradients accumulate. They provide result in very large updates to neural network model weights during training.\n",
    "Gradient Descent process works best when updates are small and controlled. When the magnitudes of the gradient accumulate, an unstable network is likely to occur. It can cause poor prediction of results or even a model that reports nothing useful."
